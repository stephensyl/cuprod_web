                        <p id="bio">My music is a collage of underground genres, gathering inspiration from artists like Bixby, Ericdoa, Wolfacejoeyy, Avenoire, and more. I started making music as a hobby in high school and haven’t been able to stop since. I will be on the upcoming album, both as a producer and an artist so stay tuned!!</p>

                        <h3>Escape2eclipse - Naomi Boyd</h3>
                        <p id="bio">My love for music began when I was kid, always singing songs around the house and playing piano as a child. However, my real love for music started when I had torn my ACL and taught myself to play guitar out of boredom. Just like my music taste, my music is all over the place - it can be sad and emo or really upbeat music. Most of my songs start with poems I write while delirious which inspires my craziest ideas. This year I’ll be releasing an album, “The Way It Is,” which displays my dark-moody side, inspired by artists like Billie Eilish, Orla Gartland, Jade LeMac and others. Look out for my song on the CMP album, Numbing!</p>

                        <h3>Timo Isreb</h3>
                        <p id="bio">I started making music because I had to- it’s my method of processing life. When you listen to one of my songs, you're being placed inside the mind of a character, and asked to judge what you hear. My shit's cerebral & psychedelic but it's also very groovy and not too self-serious. It's a hard balance to strike, but I have fun striking it! Fun fact: I studied film for 7 years before realizing I liked music production more. I plan to be on the upcoming album!</p>

                        <p id="bio">Describing my music is as hard as describing emotion. It’s ethereal, it's dark, and it's romantic. I consider myself genre-less, experimenting with different sounds and collaborating with different producers and artists. I started making music for all the same reasons as anyone else, “bringing my visions to life.” I just want to give all the little passion projects in my head a home. If you want a taste of my music go listen to the newest CMP album, where I’m featured on 4 tracks.</p>
